# Content Ownership

A WordPress plugin that adds per-page review intervals, content ownership, hierarchical settings inheritance, batched cron-driven email digests, a Gutenberg editor sidebar, an admin dashboard widget, and a React-based page-tree admin UI.

This is a stand-alone generic WordPress plugin. It does not depend on any specific theme or framework.

## Requirements

- PHP 8.1+
- WordPress 6.5+
- Node.js 18+ (build-time only)

## Installation (development)

```bash
composer install
npm install
npm run build
```

Then activate the plugin in **wp-admin → Plugins**.

## Installation (test / production ZIP)

Releases are built in CI from a tag on `main`. The ZIP includes `vendor/` and `dist/`; you do **not** need Node or Composer on the server.

1. Download the ZIP from the GitHub Release for your tag (see **[RELEASE.md](RELEASE.md)**).
2. **Plugins → Add New → Upload Plugin** and activate.

To build a ZIP locally:

```bash
composer install
npm ci
npm run release
```

Output: `.build/content-ownership-<version>.zip`

```

Each service constructor self-registers its WordPress hooks. `App::boot()` wires the object graph; it contains no `add_action` calls of its own. This keeps the dependency graph explicit and the bootstrap class small.

## Data model

| Where                                | What                                                                 |
| ------------------------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `wp_options.content_ownership_settings` | `GlobalSettings` JSON (`default_interval_days`, `notify_days_before`, `send_reminder_after_due`, `reminder_cadence_days`, `default_recipient_emails`, `cron_batch_size`, `sync_wp_modified_on_review`) |
| `wp_postmeta._content_ownership_rule`   | Per-page `Rule` JSON: `{interval_days, recipients, notify_before}` each as `{value, scope}` where `scope ∈ 'self' | 'subtree'`. `recipients` is a list of typed `Target` objects (see below). Legacy `owners` keys are merged into `recipients` on load. |
| `wp_postmeta._content_ownership_last_reviewed_at` | ISO 8601 string, set by the row action / REST mark-reviewed / Gutenberg button |
| `wp_postmeta._content_ownership_last_reviewed_by` | WP user ID                                          |
| `wp_postmeta._content_ownership_last_notified_at` | ISO 8601 string of the last sent reminder; throttles notifications |

Empty rules are deleted from post meta automatically — no orphan rows.

## Target model (who to notify)

`recipients` is a list of `Target` objects rather than plain ID or email arrays. Every target has the shape `{ type, value }`:

| `type`  | `value`            | Dashboard widget | Email notifications |
| ------- | ------------------ | ---------------- | ------------------- |
| `user`  | `int` (WP user ID) | Yes              | Yes (via WP account email) |
| `role`  | `string` (slug)    | Yes (role members) | Yes (expanded at cron time) |
| `email` | `string`           | No               | Yes (standalone mailbox) |

Example rule fragment:

```json
{
  "recipients": {
    "value": [
      { "type": "user",  "value": 7 },
      { "type": "role",  "value": "pitea-content-team" },
      { "type": "email", "value": "frididkultur@pitea.se" }
    ],
    "scope": "subtree"
  }
}
```

Role targets are expanded **at notification time** by `ReviewScanner`, so changing a role's membership in WP (or via a SAML/OIDC sync) is reflected on the very next cron run. Roles that no longer exist simply expand to zero users — no error, no notifications.

Legacy data shapes (plain integer arrays in the old `owners` field, plain string arrays in `recipients`) are still accepted by `Rule::fromArray()` and merged into `recipients` on load.

## Inheritance model (tri-state)

A page's effective value for each field (`interval_days`, `recipients`, `notify_before`) resolves as follows:

1. If the page has a **local** rule for that field → use it.
2. Otherwise walk ancestors top-down looking for the nearest ancestor with a **subtree** rule for that field → use it.
3. Otherwise fall back to global settings.

Resolution is **lazy**: there is no materialized table of effective settings. `InheritanceResolver::resolveForPage()` does the ancestor walk on demand (cached per request via `WpPageHierarchy`). `InheritanceResolver::walkTree()` is the bulk DFS used by cron.

## Who sees review status in wp-admin

The Pages list badges ("Review overdue" / "Review due soon"), the dashboard widget, and the REST `/dashboard` endpoint all use the same visibility rules via `RecipientVisibility`:

| Viewer | Sees status for… |
| ------ | ---------------- |
| Assigned recipient (WP user or role member) | Pages where they appear in the effective `recipients` list (including nested pages via inheritance) |
| Site overview user (default: `overview_capability`, usually `manage_options`) | **All** pages that need review — oversight only, not personal responsibility |
| Standalone email targets | Never — they receive email digests but have no WP account |

Email-only recipient pages show no badge to any WP user unless a site overview user is viewing.

Override via filters:

- `content_ownership/can_view_site_overview` — grant or revoke site-wide overview per user
- `content_ownership/post_states/show` — per-page override for Pages list badges

## REST API

Namespace: `content-ownership/v1`. All endpoints require `is_user_logged_in()` minimum.

| Method   | Path                                       | Permission | Purpose                                                            |
| -------- | ------------------------------------------ | ---------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| GET/POST | `/settings`                                | Settings admin | Read or write `GlobalSettings`                                 |
| GET      | `/dashboard?bucket=...`                    | Logged in (filtered) | Pages needing review for the current user              |
| GET      | `/tree?parent=<id>`                        | Settings admin | Shallow tree node listing (for the React tree)                 |
| GET      | `/pages/<id>/rule`                         | Recipient, overview, or settings admin | Read rule + effective settings + review status |
| PUT      | `/pages/<id>/rule`                         | Settings admin | Write per-page rule                                        |
| POST     | `/pages/<id>/mark-reviewed`                | Recipient, overview, or settings admin | Stamp last_reviewed meta                       |
| POST     | `/cron/run-now`                            | Settings admin | Run a full synchronous scan and send digest emails             |
| GET      | `/cron/schedule-info`                      | Settings admin | Read automatic scan schedule and next WP-Cron run              |
| GET      | `/roles`                                   | Settings admin | Selectable WP roles for the group picker                       |
| GET      | `/users?search=&role=&per_page=&include=`  | Settings admin | Async user search for the picker + role-member preview         |

The `/pages/<id>/rule` GET response also includes `last_reviewed_at`, `last_reviewed_by`, `next_review_at`, and `bucket` so the editor sidebar renders in a single request.

## Public extension API

All actions and filters are namespaced under `content_ownership/...`.

### Actions

| Action                                        | Args                                             | Fired by                       | When                                 |

### Example: redirect owner reminders to a Slack webhook instead of email

```php
add_action('content_ownership/cron/run_completed', function (array $state, array $grouped): void {
    foreach ($grouped as $key => $items) {
        if (!str_starts_with($key, 'user:')) continue;
        $userId = (int) substr($key, 5);
        $hook   = get_user_meta($userId, 'slack_webhook', true);
        if (!$hook) continue;
        wp_remote_post($hook, [
            'body' => wp_json_encode([
                'text' => sprintf('%d page(s) need review', count($items)),
            ]),
        ]);
    }
}, 5, 2);

// And opt those same users out of email digests:
add_filter('content_ownership/owner/should_notify', function (bool $should, int $userId): bool {
    return $should && !get_user_meta($userId, 'slack_webhook', true);
}, 10, 2);
```

### Example: hide WP default roles from the picker, expose only SAML-imported ones

```php
add_filter('content_ownership/selectable_roles', function (array $slugs): array {
    $defaults = ['administrator', 'editor', 'author', 'contributor', 'subscriber'];
    return array_values(array_diff($slugs, $defaults));
});
```

### Example: stop the scanner from touching auto-draft pages

```php
add_filter('content_ownership/cron/should_process_page', function (bool $should, int $pageId): bool {
    return $should && get_post_status($pageId) !== 'auto-draft';
}, 10, 2);
```

## Reminders (email throttling)

Two global settings under **General settings → Reminders** control repeat digests:

| Setting | Behaviour |
| ------- | --------- |
| **Send reminders after due date** | **Off:** each page is notified at most **once** while it stays due/overdue. Marking it reviewed clears notification state so the next review cycle can email again. **On:** the same page may be included again after the cadence interval if it is still due or overdue. |
| **Reminder cadence (days)** | When repeat reminders are **on**, minimum gap before the **same page** can be queued again. Ignored when repeat reminders are off (the one-shot rule applies instead). |

Digest grouping is **per recipient per cron run** — all eligible pages for that person appear in one email, regardless of review date.

### Current cadence model (per page)

`_content_ownership_last_notified_at` is stored on each **page**. Cadence throttles re-notifying that page, not how often a person receives mail overall.

**Implication:** if you own many pages that become due on different days, you may receive **more than one email per cadence period** (e.g. one digest when page A is due, another when page B becomes due a day later). Pages are not lost — they wait for the next eligible cron run.

### Possible future change (per recipient) — not implemented

A **per-recipient cadence** would cap digest mail to at most one email per address every N days and batch all actionable pages into that single mail. That avoids staggered daily digests when someone owns many pages. Tracked as a future improvement; the plugin still uses per-page cadence today.

## Scanning & WP-Cron

Three ways to start a scan:

| Trigger | Mode | Behaviour |
| ------- | ---- | --------- |
| **Run scan now** (admin SPA header) | Synchronous | Processes all batches in one request, sends emails, returns stats |
| **Schedule tab → WP Cron** | Background | Registers `content_ownership_daily` at the configured time; when that event runs it schedules batched `content_ownership_tick` events |
| **WP-CLI** | Sync or background | See below |

### WP-CLI

```bash
# Synchronous — recommended when DISABLE_WP_CRON is true
wp content-ownership scan

# Background — schedules batched ticks (requires something to execute due WP events)
wp content-ownership scan --background
```

Server crontab example (sync, daily at 22:00):

```bash
0 22 * * * cd /path/to/wordpress && wp --path=wp content-ownership scan
```

If using `--background`, also run due WP events regularly:

```bash
* * * * * cd /path/to/wordpress && wp --path=wp cron event run --due-now
```

### Background tick pipeline

When a scan runs in **background** mode (`content_ownership_daily`, `--background`, or legacy tick resume):

1. Acquires a transient lock (6 hours) to prevent overlap.
2. Processes up to `cron_batch_size` pages per tick (filterable).
3. Persists `RunState` (cursor, totals) in a transient.
4. If more pages remain, reschedules `content_ownership_tick` (+60 seconds).
5. When complete, fires `content_ownership/cron/run_completed` which the dispatcher consumes.

**Important:** WP Cron settings in the Schedule tab **register** the daily event — they do not execute it. Something must run due scheduled events (page loads with WP-Cron enabled, or `wp cron event run --due-now` from server crontab).

On deactivation the daily event, any pending tick events, and run-state transients are cleared.

## Permission layers

The plugin separates three independent concerns. They must not be conflated — a user can hold one, two, or all three.

| Layer | Who | What they can do | Configured via |
| ----- | --- | ---------------- | -------------- |
| **Plugin configuration** | Users passing `content_ownership/can_manage_settings` (default: `user_can(admin_capability)`) | Open the settings SPA, change global defaults, browse the page tree, run cron manually | `admin_capability` + `content_ownership/can_manage_settings` filter |
| **Site-wide overview** | Users passing `content_ownership/can_view_site_overview` (default: `user_can(overview_capability)`) | See review badges and dashboard entries for **all** actionable pages, and mark any page reviewed | `overview_capability` + `content_ownership/can_view_site_overview` filter |
| **Content owner** | Users or roles listed in a page's effective `recipients` | See review status and mark pages reviewed for pages they are assigned to (including nested pages via inheritance) | Per-page rules in the admin SPA |

**Editor workflow (content owners only):** dashboard widget, Pages list badges, Gutenberg sidebar, row actions, and email digests. None of these require the settings SPA. Links to the settings page are shown only to users who pass `content_ownership/can_manage_settings`.

**WordPress page editing** (`edit_post`) is separate from ownership actions. Editors who are not configured recipients can still edit page content in WordPress, but they do not see ownership UI or mark pages reviewed.

Per-page ownership actions (view status, mark reviewed) are gated by `PageAuthorization`: recipient assignment, site overview, or settings admin. Rule writes (`PUT /pages/<id>/rule`) require settings admin only.

Site-specific tuning (for example, restrict both overview and settings access to the `administrator` role while other `manage_options` users remain content owners only) is done with `content_ownership/can_view_site_overview` and `content_ownership/can_manage_settings` in site code — not by hardcoding roles in the plugin.

The legacy `capability` config key is still read as a fallback when either dedicated key is missing.

## Testing

```bash
composer test                                        # all tests
php vendor/bin/phpunit tests/Unit/Domain             # domain only
php vendor/bin/phpunit tests/Unit/Notifications      # notifications only
```

Domain logic is fully unit-tested with in-memory fakes for `RuleSource`, `PageHierarchy`, and `NotificationQueueInterface`, so the inheritance resolver, cron scanner, and email renderer run without WordPress loaded.
